## Common Issues

### "Insufficient SOL balance"

Make sure you have at least 0.004 SOL in your wallet to cover NFT creation and network fees.

### "Transaction failed"

This usually happens due to network congestion. Try again in a few moments.

### "Cannot view chat"

Ensure you own the NFT for this conversation. Check your wallet's NFT collection.

### "Wallet not connecting on mobile"

1. Use Phantom or Solflare mobile app's built-in browser
2. Make sure you're on dapp.stork-sms.net (not a copycat site)
3. Try refreshing the page within the wallet app
4. Ensure your wallet app is updated to the latest version
