# Frequently Asked Questions

Get answers to the most common questions about Stork SMS, from basic usage to advanced features.

## General Questions

### What is Stork SMS?

Stork SMS is a decentralized messaging platform built on the Solana blockchain that combines traditional messaging features with Web3 technology. It uses NFTs for access control and provides end-to-end encryption for secure communication.

### How is Stork SMS different from traditional messaging apps?

**Key Differences:**
- **True Ownership**: Your messages are truly yours, stored encrypted and accessible only to you
- **No Phone Numbers**: Uses Solana wallet addresses instead of phone numbers
- **NFT-Based Access**: Each conversation is secured by NFT ownership
- **Decentralized**: No central authority can access or block your messages
- **Blockchain Benefits**: Transparent, verifiable, and censorship-resistant

### Do I need to know about cryptocurrency to use Stork SMS?

While Stork SMS is built on blockchain technology, we've designed it to be user-friendly for everyone. You'll need:
- A Solana wallet (we'll guide you through setup)
- A small amount of SOL for transaction fees
- Basic understanding of connecting your wallet

Our interface is designed to feel like a regular messaging app with the added benefits of Web3.

## Getting Started

### What wallets are supported?

Stork SMS supports all major Solana wallets:
- **Phantom** (recommended for beginners)
- **Solflare** (mobile and desktop)
- **Ledger** (hardware wallet for security)
- **Torus** (social login option)

### How much does it cost to use Stork SMS?

**Current Costs:**
- **Chat Creation**: ~0.001 SOL (~$0.10) for dual NFT creation
- **Messages**: Free to send once chat is created
- **File Sharing**: Free for images and voice messages
- **Network Fees**: Minimal Solana transaction fees

**Compared to traditional NFTs**: Our compressed NFTs cost 99% less than regular NFTs, making messaging affordable for everyone.

### How do I create my first chat?

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Connect your Solana wallet to Stork SMS
2. **Enter Recipient Address**: Paste the wallet address of who you want to message
3. **Pay Creation Fee**: Confirm the small fee (creates NFTs for both parties)
4. **Start Messaging**: Once NFTs are created, you can start messaging immediately

The recipient will automatically have access to the chat through their NFT.

### Why do I need to pay a fee to create a chat?

The fee covers:
- **Dual NFT Creation**: Creates access NFTs for both sender and recipient
- **Solana Network Fees**: Blockchain transaction costs
- **Permanent Access**: Once created, messaging is free forever
- **True Ownership**: Your NFTs represent permanent chat access

This one-time fee ensures spam prevention and gives you permanent, transferable chat access.

## Technical Questions

### How secure is my data?

**Multiple Security Layers:**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Messages encrypted with AES-256-GCM before leaving your device
- **Key Derivation**: Encryption keys derived from your wallet, never stored anywhere
- **Zero-Knowledge**: We never see your unencrypted messages
- **Blockchain Security**: Access control secured by Solana blockchain
- **No Backdoors**: Mathematically impossible for anyone (including us) to read your messages

### What happens if I lose my wallet?

**Important**: Your wallet is your key to everything in Stork SMS.

**If you lose access:**
- Messages become unreadable (we can't recover them)
- NFT access is lost unless you have backup/recovery phrases
- New wallet means starting fresh

**Prevention:**
- Always backup your wallet recovery phrase
- Consider using a hardware wallet for security
- Keep multiple secure backups in different locations

### Can I transfer my chat access to someone else?

**Yes!** This is one of the unique benefits of NFT-based messaging:
- **NFT Transfer**: Transfer your chat NFT to another wallet
- **Permanent Access**: New owner gets full chat history access
- **Marketplace Trading**: Could potentially sell chat access (if valuable)
- **Inheritance**: Pass chat access to family members

This makes your conversations truly owned assets.

### What data do you collect?
